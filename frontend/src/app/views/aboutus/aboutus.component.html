      <p class="text-muted">
        Founded in early 2024 as a student project by a group of passionate tech enthusiasts, Eventura was born out of a simple idea: making event management easy for everyone.
        Initially started as a college assignment, it quickly grew into a functional platform that handles everything from event listings to attendee registration. What started with a whiteboard sketch and late-night coding sessions is now a prototype used in demo events and student showcases.

      <p class="text-muted">
        With support from faculty and feedback from peers, Eventura evolved into a real-world-ready solution. Though fictional for now, our ambition is real — and Eventura is proof that great ideas can come from classrooms.
